# L298N_Arduinonano_rp2040_Raspberrypi_Serial
Program is to control two dc motors connected to the Arduino nano rp2040 using a serial connection with raspberry pi4. I made a tkinter GUI with CW, CCW and Stop button to send commands to the Arduino depending on which GUI button is clicked. Below are the tkinter GUI screenshots after running the program
